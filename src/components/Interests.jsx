        <p>Beyond my work as a web developer and software engineer, I am deeply fascinated by the ongoing advancements in technology, especially in the realms of AI and machine learning. I constantly explore the latest trends and innovations in these fields, always eager to learn and apply new concepts.
        </p>
        <p> In addition to my tech interests, I am a huge fan of sci-fi and fantasy movies. The creativity and imagination in these genres inspire me and fuel my passion for innovation. I also enjoy experimenting in the kitchen, where I explore new cooking techniques and recipes, making the most of my culinary creativity.</p>
        <p className="mb-0">When I'm not immersed in technology or cooking, I love spending time outdoors, whether it's hiking, biking, or simply enjoying nature. These activities provide me with balance and inspiration for both my personal and professional life.</p>
